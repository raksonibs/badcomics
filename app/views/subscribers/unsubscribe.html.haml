      I didn't mean that. I am sorry. You just probably don't like emails. You are all about time efficency. We get that. YOu like to get a job done quick and fast. So do we. I guess we have a lot in common, us and you. I mean, we would probably be great friends. I am sorry for all that stuff I pulled back there, with the slander and dreams. I mean, we're both just average guys, trying to have a few good laughs before we die. YOu know, that final end, which we all kind know is coming but are trying to avoid. I mean, I guess I am just saying is I am afraid of it all, you know, what is coming and what isn't. I guess I just wanted that subscription to enver end, for us to become friends, virtually and trhough comedy. I mean people can change right?
